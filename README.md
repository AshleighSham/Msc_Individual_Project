The Bayesian Inference approach, incorporating Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods and the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), is applied to identify various material parameters in linear and nonlinear solid mechanics problems, encompassing homogeneous and heterogeneous models. The Finite Element Method (FEM) is utilised in the forward models, employing quadrilateral element mesh grids. Observation data, synthetically generated to enable a rigorous assessment of the algorithms' effectiveness, are further perturbed with additive Gaussian noise to simulate the model uncertainty typically encountered in real-world scenarios. The study implements the Ensemble Kalman Filter and the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm, with a particular focus on proposal kernel adaptation and delayed rejection variants. The computational time and accuracy of these algorithms are assessed to evaluate their overall performance.
